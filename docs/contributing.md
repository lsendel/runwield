# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Harns. Harns is source-available and accepts issues and pull requests, but it is not open
source yet. Before contributing, read the [license](../LICENSE).

## Start with the design docs

Harns has strong workflow opinions. Before changing behavior, read the docs that explain the current model:

## Development setup

Contributors use Deno.

```bash
deno task cli "your request"
deno task check
deno task test
deno task ci
deno task compile
```

`deno task ci` runs check, lint, format check, and tests.

Development and interactive workflow testing use these binaries in `PATH`:

- [`mnemosyne`](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne) for memory-backed agent behavior.
- [`cymbal`](https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal) for code intelligence.
- [`rtk`](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) for compact command-output rewriting. Harns runtime treats rtk as optional, but
  the repository's Deno tasks use it for compact lint/test/check output.

  **How Harns integrates rtk at runtime:**

  During session setup (`src/shared/session/session.js`), Harns checks whether `rtk` is on `PATH`. If found, it
  registers the `rtkExtension` from `src/extensions/rtk/index.js` as a `tool_call` event handler.

  The extension listens for agent-initiated `bash` tool calls and runs `rtk rewrite "<original command>"` via `pi.exec`.
  If the rewrite succeeds and returns a different command, Harns mutates the bash tool input in place so the agent sees
  compact output from the piped command. The extension skips non-`bash` tools, empty commands, and commands already
  prefixed with `rtk`. If rtk is missing or the rewrite fails for any reason, the original command runs unchanged
  (fail-open). Manual `!`/`!!` shell shortcuts are never rewritten — the hook only intercepts programmatic agent bash
  tool calls.

## Code style

- Write pure JavaScript (`.js`). Do not add TypeScript files.
- Use JSDoc for types. Do not use TypeScript syntax in executable code.
- Keep CLI entry points thin. Command behavior belongs under `src/cmd/<command>/` and shared behavior belongs under
  `src/shared/`.
- Preserve the layered customization model: project `.hns/` overrides home `~/.hns/`, which overrides bundled defaults.
- Keep docs and plans as Markdown.

## Pull request checklist

1. Create a branch.
2. Make focused changes.
3. Update docs when behavior changes.
4. Run `deno task ci` for code changes.
5. For docs-only or config-only changes, run `deno fmt`.
6. Open a PR with:
   - a summary,
   - the affected routing intent or flow (`INQUIRY`, `IDEATION`, `QUICK_FIX`, `FEATURE`, or `PROJECT`),
   - validation notes,
   - any follow-up work or known gaps.

## Workflow expectations

Harns itself is plan-by-default for non-trivial work. Contributions should preserve that product shape:

- `INQUIRY` handling should stay answer-focused through Guide.
- `IDEATION` handling should clarify ideas through Ideator before routing implementation work.
- `QUICK_FIX` work should stay small and self-verified.
- `FEATURE` work should be traceable to a reviewable plan when the blast radius is non-trivial.
- `PROJECT` work should be represented as an Epic: Architect owns the design, interactive Slicer owns child FEATURE
  boundaries, and execution happens through those child FEATURE plans.
- Workflow validation should remain an independent acceptance gate for saved plan execution.
