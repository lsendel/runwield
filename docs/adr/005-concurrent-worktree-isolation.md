# ADR-005: Concurrent Execution Isolation via Git Worktrees

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Harns previously executed plan work in the primary working tree (CWD = `Deno.cwd()`). This meant:

- Two Harns instances executing plans concurrently could step on each other's file changes.
- Failed execution recovery could reset the primary checkout to a baseline snapshot and destroy unrelated user edits.
- Plan recovery had no isolated place to inspect, merge, continue, or discard a partial execution.

ADR-003 introduced execution baseline trees (git tree objects captured before execution) as a lightweight recovery
mechanism, but those trees operated on the same working tree. ADR-004 centralized the plan lifecycle, but did not change
the single-worktree constraint.

We need a mechanism that lets multiple Harns instances, or multiple sequential plan executions, operate independently on
the same repository.

## Decision

Use **git worktrees** (`git worktree add`) to isolate each saved plan execution into its own linked working tree.

### Isolation Granularity

**Plan-level isolation.** Each plan execution gets one worktree. Tasks within a PROJECT plan share that worktree because
they are already coordinated by the orchestrator and write-scope conflict detection runs against the same tree. This
avoids per-task worktree complexity while allowing concurrent plan executions to avoid primary-checkout conflicts.

### Worktree Lifecycle

1. **Creation** — Before `execution_started`, Harns creates or reuses a worktree branch with the prefix
   `harns/worktree/` from the selected base ref. The worktree path is created adjacent to the primary repo and includes
   a sanitized plan slug plus a short id, e.g. `../<repo>-harns-<plan-slug>-<id>`.
2. **Execution** — Implementation runs in the worktree cwd. Harns records the execution baseline tree from that
   worktree. Agent sessions and file-writing tools receive the worktree cwd explicitly; Harns does not mutate the
   process cwd with `Deno.chdir()`.
3. **Implementation complete** — `implementation_finished` means implementation finished in the worktree. It sets Plan
   Status `implemented` and worktree status `completed`, but does **not** merge the branch into the primary checkout.
4. **Validation** — Workflow Validation runs local CI, workflow diff computation, semantic review, and repair sessions
   in the execution worktree.
5. **Merge-back** — Only after Workflow Validation passes does Harns merge the worktree branch into the primary
   checkout. `validation_passed` and Plan Status `verified` are recorded only after that merge succeeds.
6. **Recovery/failure** — If execution, validation, or merge-back fails, the worktree is left in place. Recovery can
   inspect, continue, retry validation, merge, recreate, or abandon the isolated worktree depending on plan state.

### CWD Plumbing

`CWD` remains the primary project root. It anchors saved plan files, Harns settings, `.hns/worktrees.json`, and
`.hns/worktrees.lock`.

Execution code must pass an explicit execution cwd to every operation that reads or writes implementation files:

- `runAgentSession()` / agent session creation
- built-in file tools and custom edit tools
- PROJECT task sub-sessions
- local CI
- workflow diff computation
- reviewer sessions
- operator/engineer repair sessions
- git snapshot helpers that operate on the implementation tree

Prompt templates, settings, plan metadata updates, and worktree registry updates remain anchored to the primary project
root unless a caller explicitly needs worktree-local files.

### Worktree Registry

A persistent JSON file at `<project>/.hns/worktrees.json` tracks active and historical execution worktrees:

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "entries": [
        {
            "id": "5fe73e21",
            "planName": "add-dark-mode-toggle",
            "baseBranch": "main",
            "baseRef": "HEAD",
            "baseCommit": "abc123def...",
            "branch": "harns/worktree/add-dark-mode-toggle-5fe73e21",
            "path": "/absolute/path/to/repo-harns-add-dark-mode-toggle-5fe73e21",
            "status": "active",
            "createdAt": "2026-06-15T12:00:00.000Z",
            "updatedAt": "2026-06-15T12:00:00.000Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

A best-effort advisory lockfile at `<project>/.hns/worktrees.lock` prevents concurrent Harns instances from racing while
creating, updating, or deleting registry entries.

### Front Matter Additions

The plan's `PlanFrontMatter` includes optional worktree fields:

| Field            | Type                                                                                                                                    | Description                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `worktreeId`     | `string \| null`                                                                                                                        | Durable registry id for the execution worktree. |
| `worktreePath`   | `string \| null`                                                                                                                        | Filesystem path to the execution worktree.      |
| `worktreeBranch` | `string \| null`                                                                                                                        | Branch checked out in the execution worktree.   |
| `worktreeStatus` | `"none" \| "active" \| "completed" \| "execution_failed" \| "validation_failed" \| "merge_conflict" \| "merged" \| "abandoned" \| null` | Lifecycle status of the worktree.               |

### Merge Strategy

Harns performs a branch merge from the primary checkout after validation passes. The merge helper refuses to proceed
when the primary checkout has blocking uncommitted changes, while allowing Harns-owned metadata paths needed during the
workflow. If merge fails or is refused, Harns records `worktree_merge_failed`, keeps Plan Status `implemented`, sets
`worktreeStatus: "merge_conflict"`, and leaves the worktree branch/path intact for recovery.

Dirty primary checkout state is therefore a **merge-back risk**, not a worktree creation blocker. Worktree creation can
start from `HEAD` even when the primary checkout has unrelated uncommitted edits; those edits are not copied into the
execution worktree.

### Recovery Integration

The `load-plan` recovery flow resolves worktree context from plan front matter first and the registry second. Inspect
reports plan status, worktree status, path, branch, base ref/commit, git status, and diff from the execution baseline.

Recovery actions for worktree-backed plans include:

- **Continue execution from current worktree** for `in_progress` and `failed` plans.
- **Retry Workflow Validation** for `implemented` plans.
- **Merge worktree changes** for implemented worktrees that need merge-back.
- **Delete/recreate worktree and start over** without restoring the primary checkout.
- **Delete/abandon worktree** to discard the isolated checkout and clear plan worktree fields.
- **Re-open for review** to revise the plan.

Legacy plans with an execution baseline but no worktree metadata keep the older primary-checkout baseline reset path
with a destructive warning.

### Plan List Visibility

`hns plans` displays concise worktree state when a plan has worktree metadata, for example:

```text
Worktree: merge_conflict (harns/worktree/add-dark-mode-toggle-5fe73e21)
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Multiple Harns instances can execute plans concurrently without implementation-file conflicts.
- The primary working tree is not touched during implementation or validation repair.
- Workflow Validation checks the isolated execution result before anything is merged back.
- Plan recovery can inspect, continue, retry validation, merge, recreate, or abandon an isolated checkout.
- The worktree registry provides durable state for recovery and plan listing.

### Negative

- Worktree creation and deletion add latency to execution start/recovery.
- Disk usage increases while worktrees remain active.
- Branch namespace `harns/worktree/*` needs periodic cleanup when worktrees are abandoned.
- The `.hns/worktrees.json` registry and lockfile must be kept consistent after crashes or interrupted sessions.
- Merge-back can be blocked by dirty primary-checkout files or conflicts even after validation passes in the worktree.

### Mitigations

- Registry writes use a lockfile plus atomic temp-file-and-rename updates.
- Recovery detects missing worktree paths and can abandon or recreate isolated worktrees.
- Worktree pruning compares registry entries with filesystem/git worktree state and removes stale records.
- Merge failures keep the worktree branch/path intact and leave the plan in `implemented` for recovery.
- Baseline-tree reset remains available only for legacy no-worktree plans, with the existing destructive warning.
