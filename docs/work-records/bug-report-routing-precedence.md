# Bug Report Routing Precedence

## Summary

Router now treats an unqualified defect report as an implicit request to diagnose and repair the problem before applying
the generic informational fallback. Unknown-cause bugs receive read-only Diagnostic Triage and default to QUICK_FIX when
the likely repair is bounded, while evidence of broader design or multi-file scope can still escalate the work to
FEATURE or PROJECT. INQUIRY remains available when the user explicitly requests explanation, confirmation, report-only
handling, or no changes. A golden-set case for repeated tool calls and thinking blocks preserves the reported failure
shape and prevents future Router prompt or model changes from silently restoring the mismatch.
