# Harns Documentation

Harns is an opinionated coding harness built on top of [Pi](https://pi.dev). It keeps Pi's terminal-first agent
experience, then adds explicit triage, durable plans, role-scoped agents, workflow validation, project memory, and plan
recovery.

Use these docs for Harns-specific behavior. When a topic behaves the same as Pi, this index links to the upstream
[Pi documentation](https://pi.dev/docs/latest) instead of duplicating it.

## Get Started

### 1. Install Harns

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gandazgul/harns/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the `hns` binary and installs it to `~/.local/bin` by default. Make sure that directory is on
your `PATH`.

Contributors can also run from source:

```bash
deno run -A src/cli.js help
deno task compile
./bin/hns help
```

### 2. Install runtime helpers

Harns works best when these optional-but-expected binaries are available on `PATH`:

- `mnemosyne` for project and global memory.
- `cymbal` for code search, symbol lookup, impact analysis, and tracing.
- `rtk` for compact command-output rewriting. RTK is optional and fail-open.

### 3. Authenticate a model provider

Start an interactive session and run:

```text
/login
```

Then choose a subscription provider or API-key provider. Harns stores credentials under `~/.hns/auth.json`.

Harns uses Pi's model/provider system, so the full provider setup is documented in
[Pi Providers](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/providers). See [Harns providers](providers.md) for the Harns-specific storage
paths and commands.

### 4. Initialize a project

Run Harns from the project root:

```bash
hns init
```

`hns init` explores the repository, writes `CONTEXT.md`, stores durable project memory, and records that the project has
been initialized. You can also run `/init` inside the TUI.

### 5. Start with Router

The default command is `router`, so these are equivalent:

```bash
hns "fix the failing parser test"
hns router "fix the failing parser test"
```

Router classifies the request as one of:

- `QUICK_FIX` - execute directly with minimal ceremony.
- `FEATURE` - write a reviewable plan before implementation.
- `PROJECT` - design the larger effort, then slice it into independently executable feature plans.

## General Usage

### Work through the router by default

Use `hns "request"` when you want Harns to choose the right workflow. Router records the classification, complexity, and
affected paths before handing off to the right role.

### Talk to a specific agent when you know what you need

```bash
hns agent                  # list agents
hns agent engineer "..."   # bypass Router
```

Inside the TUI, use `/agent <name>` to switch agents.

User-selectable bundled agents include `router`, `operator`, `planner`, `architect`, `engineer`, `tester`, `doc-writer`,
and `ideator`. Harns also uses workflow-only pseudo-agents such as Slicer and Reviewer during plan readiness and
validation; they do not appear in normal `/agent` listings.

### Use plans for non-trivial work

Plans are Markdown files under `plans/` with YAML front matter. List and resume them with:

```bash
hns plans
hns load-plan <name-or-path>
```

Plans move through review, readiness, execution, validation, and recovery states. See
[Plans and workflows](workflows.md) and [Plan Lifecycle](plan-lifecycle.md).

### Use slash commands in the TUI

Type `/` to open command completion. Common commands:

| Command                        | Purpose                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/login`, `/logout`, `/status` | Manage model credentials.                                                     |
| `/model`                       | Switch active model.                                                          |
| `/agent`                       | Switch active agent.                                                          |
| `/init`                        | Initialize the current project.                                               |
| `/load-plan`                   | Continue a saved plan.                                                        |
| `/resume`, `/new`, `/session`  | Manage sessions.                                                              |
| `/compact`                     | Compact the current session context.                                          |
| `/theme`                       | Pick a theme.                                                                 |
| `/reload`                      | Reload settings, instructions, prompts, skills, models, themes, and memories. |
| `/export`, `/share`            | Export or share a session.                                                    |
| `/quit`                        | Exit.                                                                         |
