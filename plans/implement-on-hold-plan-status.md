# Implement On-Hold Plan Status

## Context

The PRD in `docs/prd/on-hold-plan-status.md` defines `on_hold` as a first-class Plan Status for intentionally deferring non-verified Plans while preserving enough context to resume safely later. The codebase already has partial scaffolding in `src/plan-store.js`, `src/shared/workflow/plan-lifecycle.js`, and `docs/plan-lifecycle.md`, but `load-plan` does not yet expose hold/resume/reset flows and `wld plans` does not group held Plans as requested.

## Objective

Add user-facing support for putting Plans on hold, resuming held Plans through a Resume Check, resetting held Plans to draft, blocking child FEATURE work while a parent Epic is on hold, and rendering held Plans in `wld plans` without making that command interactive.

## Approach

Keep lifecycle metadata canonical by using the existing `recordPlanEvent` events (`plan_held`, `hold_resumed`, `hold_reset_to_draft`) instead of direct status edits. Add small helpers in `load-plan` for hold prompts, Resume Check, and reset-to-draft handling, then thread those helpers into each existing status menu. Reuse current worktree recovery helpers and affected-path commit checks where possible. Update `wld plans` presentation by partitioning active vs held top-level Plans while keeping individually held child FEATUREs inline under active Epics.

## Files to Modify

- `src/cmd/load-plan/index.js` — add hold/resume/reset menus, Resume Check, parent-Epic hold blocking for child FEATUREs, and hold entries in existing status menus.
- `src/cmd/load-plan/index.test.js` — cover hold, resume, reset, Epic/child semantics, and menu-first behavior.
- `src/cmd/plans/index.js` — group held top-level Plans/Epics in a bottom `On Hold:` section and include held-child progress/counts.
- `src/cmd/plans/index.test.js` — cover active Epics with held children, held Epics with children, standalone held Plans, and held metadata rendering.
- `src/plan-store.js` — verify existing hold front-matter normalization/progress helpers and adjust only if needed for held-child counts or missing metadata preservation.
- `src/plan-store.test.js` — add/adjust tests if store helpers need changes.
- `src/shared/workflow/plan-lifecycle.js` — verify event constraints match the PRD; adjust only for gaps discovered during implementation.
- `src/shared/workflow/plan-lifecycle.test.js` — add/adjust tests if lifecycle constraints or reset-clearing fields change.
- `src/shared/worktree.js` — add a non-mutating merge-risk inspection helper if needed so Resume Check can report mergeability/risk without invoking the mutating merge path.
- `src/shared/worktree.test.js` — cover any new merge-risk helper behavior.

## Reuse Opportunities

- `recordPlanEvent` / `buildPlanEventUpdates` in `src/shared/workflow/plan-lifecycle.js` — existing hold events and metadata clearing.
- `resolveRecoveryWorktree`, `hasWorktreeContext`, `confirmWorktreeAction`, and `confirmRecoveryWorktreeAvailable` in `src/cmd/load-plan/index.js` — worktree lookup and safety confirmation patterns.
- `listCommitsTouchingPathsSince` in `src/shared/workflow/git-snapshot.js` — affected-path staleness detection for Resume Check.
- `getWorktreeStatus` in `src/shared/worktree.js` — worktree existence and branch status inspection.
- Existing dirty-path/diff logic inside `mergeExecutionWorktree` in `src/shared/worktree.js` — extract/reuse as a read-only merge-risk check rather than duplicating git parsing in `load-plan`.
- `groupPlanHierarchy` / `countChildPlanProgress` in `src/plan-store.js` — hierarchy grouping for `wld plans`; extend presentation rather than duplicating store traversal.

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Add shared `load-plan` helpers for hold metadata and menus.
  - Implement an `isHoldableStatus(status)` helper that returns true for all non-`verified`, non-`closed_without_verification`, non-`on_hold` statuses.
  - Implement `getHoldStalenessBaseline(attrs)` using the last substantive pre-hold timestamp: prefer `updatedAt`, then `implementedAt`, `failedAt`, `createdAt` as available; do not use `heldAt`.
  - Implement `putPlanOnHold({ plan, uiAPI, recordPlanEvent, findPlansByParent })` that prompts for optional reason with `uiAPI.promptText`, confirms Epic/child warnings from the PRD, records `plan_held`, updates in-memory attrs, and reports the plan remains resumable via `wld load-plan <name>`.
  - Keep prompt labels exactly aligned with the PRD: `Put on hold`, `Resume from hold`, `Reset status to draft`, `Keep on hold`, `View plan details`.

- [ ] Step 2: Add Resume Check and held-plan handling to `load-plan`.
  - Add `runResumeCheck({ plan, uiAPI, listCommitsTouchingPathsSince, findWorktreeById, findWorktreeByPlanName, getWorktreeStatus })` returning pass/warn/fail plus human-readable messages.
  - Check worktree existence when worktree metadata is present; check recorded branch vs current branch when applicable; report missing/mismatched worktree as fail or warning based on whether recovery is possible.
  - For worktree-backed Plans with a recorded branch, inspect merge risk against the primary checkout without mutating either checkout; report overlapping dirty primary changes or likely merge conflicts as warnings/failures.
  - Check commits touching `affectedPaths` since `holdStalenessBaseline || updatedAt || createdAt`; warnings should offer `Proceed with resume` or `Keep on hold`.
  - Add `handleOnHoldPlan(...)` with menu: `Resume from hold`, `View plan details`, `Reset status to draft`, `Cancel / Keep on hold`.
  - On pass or accepted warnings, record `hold_resumed` with `heldFromStatus`, clear hold metadata, update `plan.attrs`, then continue normal `load-plan` handling for the restored status.
  - On fail, keep `status: on_hold`, show recovery options including `Reset status to draft`.

- [ ] Step 3: Add reset-to-draft support for held Plans.
  - Implement `resetHeldPlanToDraft({ plan, uiAPI, recordPlanEvent, findWorktreeById, findWorktreeByPlanName, updateWorktreeRegistryEntry, removeExecutionWorktree })`.
  - If a worktree exists, confirm before deleting it and offer a non-destructive option that resets metadata while keeping the worktree for manual rescue.
  - Record `hold_reset_to_draft`; ensure hold fields and execution/recovery fields are cleared while plan body and stable identity/context fields remain.
  - If deleting a worktree, remove the checkout and mark/remove registry entry using existing worktree helpers; otherwise leave filesystem/registry state untouched but clear Plan metadata.

- [ ] Step 4: Make `load-plan` consistently menu-first and wire hold actions into status flows.
  - For `draft` / `feedback`, show `Resume planning`, `Put on hold`, `View plan details`, `Cancel` before starting the planning agent.
  - For `approved` / `ready_for_work`, add `Put on hold` and `Cancel` to the existing execution/review menu.
  - For `in_progress` / `failed` / `implemented`, add `Put on hold` to the recovery menu without losing current inspect/continue/reset/validate options.
  - For PROJECT Epics (`draft`, `approved`, `ready_for_decomposition`, `ready_for_work`, done-enough `verified`), keep existing Epic options but add `Put Epic on hold` only when holdable.
  - Preserve existing `verified` behavior: already verified Plans cannot be put on hold.

- [ ] Step 5: Enforce Epic and child FEATURE semantics.
  - Run the parent-Epic hold gate before handling the child Plan’s own `on_hold` state; if a child’s parent Epic is held, show the blocking message and offer loading/resuming the parent Epic or canceling.
  - Holding an Epic mutates only the Epic and warns that child FEATURE Plans will be hidden/blocked while the Epic is held.
  - Loading a child FEATURE whose parent Epic is `on_hold` must show a message and force the user to resume the parent first; do not allow an override to work on the child.
  - Resuming an Epic should show child status summary after Resume Check succeeds, but mutate only the Epic.
  - Holding a child FEATURE should warn that only that child is being held; parent and siblings remain active.
  - If both parent Epic and child FEATURE are on hold, resuming the Epic must not resume the child.

- [ ] Step 6: Update `wld plans` grouping and progress display.
  - Partition top-level held Epics and standalone held Plans into a final `On Hold:` section.
  - Keep held child FEATUREs under active Epics inline and display `status: on_hold` / held metadata there.
  - For held Epics, render the Epic under `On Hold:` with its child FEATURE tree underneath; child statuses do not change.
  - Include `Held from:` and optional `Reason:` for held Plans.
  - Update child progress strings to count `on_hold` separately, matching the PRD style (`1/3 verified — 1 on hold — 1 remaining`).

- [ ] Step 7: Add focused tests.
  - `load-plan`: normal draft/feedback menu-first behavior, putting FEATURE on hold, putting Epic on hold with warning, child FEATURE hold warning, on-hold resume pass, resume warning keep/proceed, resume fail remains held, reset-to-draft with and without worktree deletion, parent-held child blocking.
  - `wld plans`: active Epic with held child inline, held Epic in bottom section with children, standalone held Plan in bottom section, held metadata printing, progress includes held count.
  - `shared/worktree`: read-only merge-risk helper returns clean/no-risk, overlapping dirty-path warning, missing branch failure, or conflict/risk text without changing repository state.
  - Lifecycle/store tests only where implementation changes those modules.

## Verification Plan

- Automated: `deno run ci`
- Targeted during development: `deno test src/cmd/load-plan/index.test.js src/cmd/plans/index.test.js src/shared/workflow/plan-lifecycle.test.js src/plan-store.test.js`
- Manual: create sample saved Plans covering `draft`, `ready_for_work`, `implemented` with worktree metadata, an Epic with child FEATUREs, and a held child; run `wld plans` and `wld load-plan <name>` through hold/resume/reset flows.
- Expected results: held Plans are not auto-resumed, Resume Check runs before restoration, failed Resume Check keeps `status: on_hold`, reset preserves plan body but clears hold/execution metadata, and `wld plans` remains read-only with held top-level Plans grouped at the bottom.

## Edge Cases & Considerations

- Existing lifecycle/store code already includes `on_hold` support; avoid duplicating state-machine logic in command code.
- `closed_without_verification` is terminal/protected like `verified` for hold purposes even though the PRD only names `verified`; current lifecycle rejects both.
- Resume Check should be conservative: warn when history checks fail or affected-path changes are found, fail when required worktree metadata points to an unavailable/mismatched recoverable state.
- Use JavaScript plus JSDoc only; do not introduce TypeScript syntax.
- Do not make `wld plans` interactive.
