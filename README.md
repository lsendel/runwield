# RunWield

**RunWield** is an opinionated, plan-by-default coding harness for developers who want agents to slow down at the right
moments: classify the work, write a reviewable plan when the blast radius is real, execute through specialized roles,
and then prove the result.

It is built on top of [Pi](https://pi.dev), with a Deno CLI, an interactive TUI, a browser-based plan review loop via
[Plannotator](https://plannotator.ai), [Cymbal](https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal) for code intelligence, and
[Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne) for project/global memory.

> For full documentation, see **[docs/index.md](docs/index.md)**.

## Why RunWield

Most coding harnesses optimize for getting an agent typing quickly. RunWield optimizes for getting the right kind of
work done with the right amount of ceremony.

- **Triage is explicit.** Every routed request gets a routing intent: `INQUIRY`, `IDEATION`, `QUICK_FIX`, `FEATURE`, or
  `PROJECT`. Implementation work records complexity and affected paths before execution.
- **Planning is a product surface, not a prompt vibe.** Non-trivial work becomes a markdown plan in `plans/`, goes
  through Plannotator review, and can be approved, revised, saved, re-opened, or executed later.
- **Architecture and decomposition are separate jobs.** Large `PROJECT` work is designed by the Architect as an Epic,
  then decomposed into independently executable child `FEATURE` plans by the Slicer after approval.
- **Execution is role-scoped.** Operators handle small fixes, Engineers implement approved plans, Testers write or run
  test work, documentation is handled through the `documentation` skill, and Reviewers compare the final diff to the
  plan.
- **Epic work keeps a clear trail.** PROJECT Epics stay as containers, while child FEATURE plans carry their own review,
  execution, validation, and merge history.
- **Completion has a handshake.** Execution agents are expected to call `task_completed`; for saved plan execution,
  RunWield treats that as the strong signal before running validation.
- **Validation is built into plan workflows.** After completed executable plan work, RunWield runs the configured local
  validation command and then a semantic review loop against the original plan. PROJECT Epics validate through their
  child FEATURE plans.
- **Context is durable.** Sessions live under `~/.wld/sessions/`, settings under `~/.wld/settings.json`, plans in the
  repo, and [Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne) keeps recallable project and global memory.

Use RunWield when you want an agent workflow that leaves durable plans, review points, validation notes, and a clear
record of why each change happened. Use a lighter harness when you only want a one-shot chat wrapper around edit tools.

## Installation

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gandazgul/runwield/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the latest release binary for macOS or Linux, verifies checksums, and installs `wld`. By default
it installs to `~/.local/bin` and does not require root. To choose another user-writable directory, set
`WLD_INSTALL_DIR`.

### From Source

```bash
deno run -A src/cli.js help
deno task compile
./bin/wld help
```

## Runtime Requirements

End users run the standalone `wld` binary. Contributors use Deno.

Interactive agent workflows require these binaries in `PATH`:

- [`mnemosyne`](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne) for project/global memory
- [`cymbal`](https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal) for code search, symbol lookup, impact analysis, and tracing

RunWield also uses [`snip`](https://github.com/edouard-claude/snip) when `snip` is available in `PATH`. Snip proxies
eligible agent-initiated shell commands so agents see compact command output. Snip is optional and fail-open: if it is
missing, RunWield skips the prefix hook and shows a short warning on the first few boots for each project. Manual `!`
and `!!` shell commands are never rewritten. RunWield ships Snip filters for `deno check`, `deno fmt`, `deno lint`, and
`deno test`. The installer can opt-in install those filters into Snip's default user filter directory so plain
`snip run -- deno ...` commands can use them; remove those user-level copies with `wld snip-filters cleanup`.

RunWield stores its own data under `~/.wld/`:

- `~/.wld/sessions/` for session history
- `~/.wld/settings.json` for global settings
- `~/.wld/RUNWEILD.md` or `~/.wld/AGENTS.md` for global RunWield instructions
- `~/.wld/agents/` for home-level agent overrides
- `~/.wld/prompts/` for home-level prompt templates

By default, RunWield also reads shared multi-agent instructions from `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` when no RunWield-owned global
instruction file exists. Disable that shared fallback with `"enableExternalGlobalAgentsMd": false` in
`~/.wld/settings.json`.

For editor autocomplete and validation, `~/.wld/settings.json` and `.wld/settings.json` can include
`"$schema": "https://github.com/gandazgul/runwield/releases/latest/download/config.schema.json"`. See
[docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for the complete settings reference.

Project-level plans and optional overrides live in the current repository:

- `plans/*.md`
- `.wld/settings.json`
- `.wld/agents/*.md`
- `.wld/prompts/*.md`

> For full documentation, see **[docs/index.md](docs/index.md)**.

## First Run

Initialize RunWield in a project when you want it to build durable context:

```bash
wld init
```

The init agent explores the repository, writes `CONTEXT.md`, stores core memories, and records that init has run for
that project. You can also run `/init` inside an interactive session.

Then start a request:

```bash
wld "fix the failing parser test"
```

The default command is `router`, so this is equivalent:

```bash
wld router "fix the failing parser test"
```

Interactive sessions are optimized for one topic at a time. A new session starts with Router, but after Router hands off
to Guide, Ideator, Operator, Planner, Architect, or another specialist, that specialist remains active so follow-up
messages keep the useful working context. Use `/new` to start a fresh session, or `/agent router` when you want the next
message in the same session to go through triage again. Router is the default triage Agent, not a special runtime path;
workflow steps are triggered by tools like `triage_report`, `plan_written`, and `task_completed`.

## Common Commands

```bash
wld "your request"                  # route through triage
wld router "your request"           # explicit router form
wld agent                           # list available agents
wld agent engineer "implement X"    # start with Engineer instead of Router
wld plans                           # list saved plans
wld plans ui --no-open              # start the local read-only Plans Workspace
wld load-plan <name-or-path>        # review, execute, or continue a plan
wld init                            # bootstrap project context
wld snip-filters install            # optional: install Deno filters for plain snip commands
wld snip-filters cleanup            # remove RunWield-managed user Snip filters
wld help
wld help <command>
```

`wld help` and `wld help <command>` are generated from the command registry. Inside the TUI, `/` autocomplete is built
from the same registry plus installed prompt templates and skills.

Prompt templates from `src/prompt-templates/`, `~/.wld/prompts/`, and `.wld/prompts/` also become slash commands when
they do not collide with built-ins. Bundled skills can be invoked as `/skill:<name>`.

## Skills

RunWield intentionally focuses on skill discovery and invocation rather than becoming another skill package manager. It
loads skills from these locations, in priority order:

1. Local project skills: `<repo>/.wld/skills`
2. Home skills: `~/.wld/skills`
3. Bundled skills: `src/skills`
4. External ecosystem skills: `~/.agents/skills`

Each skill lives in a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Skills are advertised to agents by name and description, and the
full instructions are injected only when a user invokes the skill with `/skill:<name>` or an agent loads a matching
skill. The bundled `documentation` skill guides Markdown docs work that used to require a dedicated docs role.

External tools can own skill installation and updates. RunWield should interoperate with that ecosystem by reading
`~/.agents/skills`, making loaded skills visible, and providing clear invocation behavior.

## Plans

Plans are markdown files with YAML front matter in `plans/`. RunWield records:

- routing intent: `INQUIRY`, `IDEATION`, `QUICK_FIX`, `FEATURE`, or `PROJECT` for routed requests
- plan classification: `FEATURE` or `PROJECT` for saved implementation plans
- complexity: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`
- summary and affected paths
- status: `draft`, `feedback`, `approved`, `ready_for_decomposition`, `ready_for_work`, `in_progress`, `failed`,
  `implemented`, `verified`, `closed_without_verification`, or `on_hold`
- origin: `internal` or `external`
- Epic metadata: `type: epic` on PROJECT Epic containers, plus `parentPlan` and optional `dependencies` on child FEATURE
  plans

PROJECT plans are Epics by default: the parent PROJECT plan is a container for design and decomposition state, not an
implementation unit. The interactive Slicer helps choose vertical child FEATURE boundaries, writes draft children under
`plans/<epic-name>/`, and finalizes the Epic only after explicit confirmation. Each child FEATURE then follows the
normal FEATURE lifecycle with its own review, execution, validation, and merge history.

Use `wld plans` to list saved plans. Epic children are grouped under their parent, and orphaned child plans are shown
separately.

Use `wld plans ui` to launch the local browser Workspace for the current checkout:

```bash
wld plans ui --no-open
```

The Workspace is a read-only milestone: it shows Board, Closed, On Hold, and Plan detail views, but does not provide
edit, drag/drop, or lifecycle mutation controls. It serves non-archived Plans from the checkout where the command was
started and uses stable `planId` detail URLs. Plans missing `planId` may be backfilled by the existing Plan resource
loader; Plan bodies and lifecycle fields are not changed by the UI.

Security defaults are intentionally local-first. The server binds to `127.0.0.1` and a random available port by default,
prints a tokenized URL, and requires that per-server token for Workspace HTML and API access. Plan markdown is local
plaintext and may contain sensitive context. If you explicitly expose the server with `--bind`/`--host` (for example
`wld plans ui --bind 0.0.0.0 --no-open`), RunWield prints a warning before serving. No permissive CORS is enabled.

Use `wld load-plan <name-or-path>` to:

- execute a ready standalone FEATURE or child FEATURE plan
- open or resume Slicer decomposition for a PROJECT Epic
- pick a child FEATURE plan from a decomposed Epic
- mark a decomposed Epic done enough for now when appropriate
- re-open an approved, implemented, or verified plan for review
- view plan or Epic details
- continue a draft or feedback plan
- load an external markdown plan and let RunWield add front matter

`/resume` is different: it resumes a recent interactive chat session, not a plan file.

## Agents

Bundled agent definitions live in [`src/agent-definitions/`](src/agent-definitions/). They are markdown files with front
matter for name, model, description, and tools.

| Agent     | Purpose                                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Router    | Default triage Agent that calls `triage_report`.                           |
| Guide     | Answers `INQUIRY` requests and provides direct help or explanation.        |
| Ideator   | Researches and sharpens `IDEATION` requests before planning.               |
| Operator  | Executes small `QUICK_FIX` tasks and operational work directly.            |
| Planner   | Writes reviewable plans for `FEATURE` work.                                |
| Architect | Designs `PROJECT` plans without implementing code.                         |
| Slicer    | Decomposes approved PROJECT Epics into child FEATURE plans.                |
| Engineer  | Implements approved executable plans and uses skills for specialized work. |
| Tester    | Writes, updates, and runs tests for assigned work.                         |
| Reviewer  | Compares the final diff against the original plan.                         |

### Agent Overrides

Agent definitions are layered in this order, highest precedence first:

1. Local: `<repo>/.wld/agents`
2. Home: `~/.wld/agents`
3. Bundled: `src/agent-definitions`

Scalar front matter fields override lower layers. Prompt bodies append by default. A layer can set
`promptOverride: true` to replace lower-layer prompt content. Tool lists replace lower layers, but RunWield re-adds
protected tools required for its workflow.

## Themes

RunWield includes the embedded `catppuccin-mocha` theme and supports theme packages from npm, git, or local paths.

```bash
wld install npm:<package-spec>
wld install git:<url>
wld install local:<path>
wld remove <source>
```

Only JSON theme files are registered. Logic extensions, JavaScript, prompts, and skills inside packages are ignored.
Install skills with whichever external skill tooling you prefer; RunWield reads compatible skills from
`~/.agents/skills` and its local/home/bundled skill directories.

Switch themes inside the TUI with `/theme`; the picker previews themes live and persists the selected theme.

See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md) for theme package details.

## Development

```bash
deno task cli "your request"
deno task check
deno task test
deno task ci
deno task compile
```

`deno task ci` runs check, lint, format check, and tests.

The codebase is pure JavaScript with JSDoc typing. Do not add TypeScript files or TypeScript syntax.

## Troubleshooting

### [Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne) or [Cymbal](https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal) Is Missing

Interactive agent workflows require both binaries in `PATH`.

- [Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne): [quick start](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne#quick-start)
- [Cymbal](https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal): [install](https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal#install)

### Plan Review UI Does Not Open

Confirm the compiled Plannotator package can resolve:

- `@gandazgul/plannotator-pi-extension-compiled/server`
- `@gandazgul/plannotator-pi-extension-compiled/assets`

### A Saved Plan Is Not Loading

- Use `wld plans` to list plan names.
- Use `wld load-plan <name>` for a plan in `plans/`.
- Use `wld load-plan plans/<name>.md` for a direct path.
- Use `/resume` only for chat sessions.

### Agent Behavior Looks Off

- Check local overrides in `<repo>/.wld/agents/`.
- Check home overrides in `~/.wld/agents/`.
- Run `/reload` in the TUI after changing memories, settings, prompt templates, skills, models, or themes.
