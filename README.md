# Harns

**Harns** is an opinionated, plan-by-default coding harness for developers who want agents to slow down at the right
moments: classify the work, write a reviewable plan when the blast radius is real, execute through specialized roles,
and then prove the result.

It is built on top of [Pi](https://pi.dev), with a Deno CLI, an interactive TUI, a browser-based plan review loop via
[Plannotator](https://plannotator.ai), [Cymbal](https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal) for code intelligence, and
[Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne) for project/global memory.

> For full documentation, see **[docs/index.md](docs/index.md)**.

## Why Harns

Most coding harnesses optimize for getting an agent typing quickly. Harns optimizes for getting the right kind of work
done with the right amount of ceremony.

- **Triage is explicit.** Every routed request becomes `QUICK_FIX`, `FEATURE`, or `PROJECT`, with complexity and
  affected paths recorded before execution.
- **Planning is a product surface, not a prompt vibe.** Non-trivial work becomes a markdown plan in `plans/`, goes
  through Plannotator review, and can be approved, revised, saved, re-opened, or executed later.
- **Architecture and task slicing are separate jobs.** Large `PROJECT` work is designed by the Architect, then sliced
  into dependency-aware vertical tasks by the Slicer after approval.
- **Execution is role-scoped.** Operators handle small fixes, Engineers implement approved plans, Testers write or run
  test work, Doc Writers stay limited to docs, and Reviewers compare the final diff to the plan.
- **Parallel work keeps a single trail.** Project tasks can run in dependency order with bounded parallelism, while
  their final outputs are summarized back into the root session.
- **Completion has a handshake.** Execution agents are expected to call `task_completed`; for saved plan execution,
  Harns treats that as the strong signal before running validation.
- **Validation is built into plan workflows.** After completed `FEATURE` or `PROJECT` plan work, Harns runs the
  configured local validation command and then a semantic review loop against the original plan.
- **Context is durable.** Sessions live under `~/.hns/sessions/`, settings under `~/.hns/settings.json`, plans in the
  repo, and Mnemosyne keeps recallable project and global memory.

Use Harns when you want an agent workflow that leaves durable plans, review points, validation notes, and a clear record
of why each change happened. Use a lighter harness when you only want a one-shot chat wrapper around edit tools.

## Installation

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gandazgul/harns/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the latest release binary for macOS or Linux, verifies checksums, and installs `hns`. By default
it installs to `~/.local/bin` and does not require root. To choose another user-writable directory, set
`HNS_INSTALL_DIR`.

### From Source

```bash
deno run -A src/cli.js help
deno task compile
./bin/hns help
```

## Runtime Requirements

End users run the standalone `hns` binary. Contributors use Deno.

Interactive agent workflows require these binaries in `PATH`:

- `mnemosyne` for project/global memory
- `cymbal` for code search, symbol lookup, impact analysis, and tracing

Harns also uses [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) when `rtk` is available in `PATH`. RTK rewrites eligible
agent-initiated shell commands before execution so agents see compact command output. RTK is optional and fail-open: if
it is missing, Harns skips the rewrite hook and shows a short warning on the first few boots for each project. Manual
`!` and `!!` shell commands are never rewritten. Manage command exclusions in RTK's own configuration.

Harns stores its own data under `~/.hns/`:

- `~/.hns/sessions/` for session history
- `~/.hns/settings.json` for global settings
- `~/.hns/HARNS.md` or `~/.hns/AGENTS.md` for global Harns instructions
- `~/.hns/agents/` for home-level agent overrides
- `~/.hns/prompts/` for home-level prompt templates

By default, Harns also reads shared multi-agent instructions from `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` when no Harns-owned global
instruction file exists. Disable that shared fallback with `"enableExternalGlobalAgentsMd": false` in
`~/.hns/settings.json`.

Project-level plans and optional overrides live in the current repository:

- `plans/*.md`
- `.hns/settings.json`
- `.hns/agents/*.md`
- `.hns/prompts/*.md`

> For full documentation, see **[docs/index.md](docs/index.md)**.

## First Run

Initialize Harns in a project when you want it to build durable context:

```bash
hns init
```

The init agent explores the repository, writes `CONTEXT.md`, stores core memories, and records that init has run for
that project. You can also run `/init` inside an interactive session.

Then start a request:

```bash
hns "fix the failing parser test"
```

The default command is `router`, so this is equivalent:

```bash
hns router "fix the failing parser test"
```

Interactive sessions are optimized for one topic at a time. A new session starts with Router, but after Router hands off
to a specialist, that specialist remains active so follow-up messages keep the useful working context. Use `/new` to
start a fresh session, or `/agent router` when you want the next message in the same session to go through triage again.
Router is the default triage Agent, not a special runtime path; workflow steps are triggered by tools like
`triage_report`, `plan_written`, and `task_completed`.

## Common Commands

```bash
hns "your request"                  # route through triage
hns router "your request"           # explicit router form
hns agent                           # list available agents
hns agent engineer "implement X"    # start with Engineer instead of Router
hns plans                           # list saved plans
hns load-plan <name-or-path>        # review, execute, or continue a plan
hns init                            # bootstrap project context
hns help
hns help <command>
```

`hns help` and `hns help <command>` are generated from the command registry. Inside the TUI, `/` autocomplete is built
from the same registry plus installed prompt templates and skills.

Prompt templates from `src/prompt-templates/`, `~/.hns/prompts/`, and `.hns/prompts/` also become slash commands when
they do not collide with built-ins. Bundled skills can be invoked as `/skill:<name>`.

## Skills

Harns intentionally focuses on skill discovery and invocation rather than becoming another skill package manager. It
loads skills from these locations, in priority order:

1. Local project skills: `<repo>/.hns/skills`
2. Home skills: `~/.hns/skills`
3. Bundled skills: `src/skills`
4. External ecosystem skills: `~/.agents/skills`

Each skill lives in a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Skills are advertised to agents by name and description, and the
full instructions are injected only when a user invokes the skill with `/skill:<name>`.

External tools can own skill installation and updates. Harns should interoperate with that ecosystem by reading
`~/.agents/skills`, making loaded skills visible, and providing clear invocation behavior.

## Plans

Plans are markdown files with YAML front matter in `plans/`. Harns records:

- classification: `QUICK_FIX`, `FEATURE`, or `PROJECT`
- complexity: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`
- summary and affected paths
- status: `draft`, `in_review`, `approved`, `ready_for_work`, `feedback`, or `completed`
- origin: `internal` or `external`

Use `hns plans` to list saved plans.

Use `hns load-plan <name-or-path>` to:

- execute an approved plan
- re-open an approved or completed plan for review
- view plan details
- continue a draft, feedback, or in-review plan
- load an external markdown plan and let Harns add front matter

`/resume` is different: it resumes a recent interactive chat session, not a plan file.

## Agents

Bundled agent definitions live in [`src/agent-definitions/`](src/agent-definitions/). They are markdown files with front
matter for name, model, description, and tools.

| Agent      | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Router     | Default triage Agent that calls `triage_report`.                    |
| Operator   | Executes small `QUICK_FIX` tasks and operational work directly.     |
| Planner    | Writes reviewable plans for `FEATURE` work.                         |
| Architect  | Designs `PROJECT` plans without implementing code.                  |
| Slicer     | Converts approved project designs into vertical task tables.        |
| Engineer   | Implements approved plans or assigned project tasks.                |
| Tester     | Writes, updates, and runs tests for assigned work.                  |
| Doc Writer | Updates markdown documentation only.                                |
| Reviewer   | Compares the final diff against the original plan.                  |
| Ideator    | Researches and sharpens vague ideas before implementation planning. |

### Agent Overrides

Agent definitions are layered in this order, highest precedence first:

1. Local: `<repo>/.hns/agents`
2. Home: `~/.hns/agents`
3. Bundled: `src/agent-definitions`

Scalar front matter fields override lower layers. Prompt bodies append by default. A layer can set
`promptOverride: true` to replace lower-layer prompt content. Tool lists replace lower layers, but Harns re-adds
protected tools required for its workflow.

## Themes

Harns includes the embedded `catppuccin-mocha` theme and supports theme packages from npm, git, or local paths.

```bash
hns install npm:<package-spec>
hns install git:<url>
hns install local:<path>
hns remove <source>
```

Only JSON theme files are registered. Logic extensions, JavaScript, prompts, and skills inside packages are ignored.
Install skills with whichever external skill tooling you prefer; Harns reads compatible skills from `~/.agents/skills`
and its local/home/bundled skill directories.

Switch themes inside the TUI with `/theme`; the picker previews themes live and persists the selected theme.

See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md) for theme package details.

## Development

```bash
deno task cli "your request"
deno task check
deno task test
deno task ci
deno task compile
```

`deno task ci` runs check, lint, format check, and tests.

The codebase is pure JavaScript with JSDoc typing. Do not add TypeScript files or TypeScript syntax.

## Troubleshooting

### Mnemosyne or Cymbal Is Missing

Interactive agent workflows require both binaries in `PATH`.

- Mnemosyne: [https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne#quick-start]
- Cymbal: [https://github.com/1broseidon/cymbal#install]

### Plan Review UI Does Not Open

Confirm the compiled Plannotator package can resolve:

- `@gandazgul/plannotator-pi-extension-compiled/server`
- `@gandazgul/plannotator-pi-extension-compiled/assets`

### A Saved Plan Is Not Loading

- Use `hns plans` to list plan names.
- Use `hns load-plan <name>` for a plan in `plans/`.
- Use `hns load-plan plans/<name>.md` for a direct path.
- Use `/resume` only for chat sessions.

### Agent Behavior Looks Off

- Check local overrides in `<repo>/.hns/agents/`.
- Check home overrides in `~/.hns/agents/`.
- Run `/reload` in the TUI after changing memories, settings, prompt templates, skills, models, or themes.
