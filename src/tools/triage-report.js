/**
 * @module triage-report
 * Custom tool for the Router to output a structured triage report.
 *
 * The tool only captures classification + summary + affectedPaths and surfaces
 * them via the tool result. Post-triage dispatch (Operator/Planner/Architect)
 * is handled by the router orchestrator in `src/cmd/router/index.js`, which
 * reads the latest triage_report outcome after the router session ends.
