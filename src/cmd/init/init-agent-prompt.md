We are initializing Harns into this project. We need to gather the project context and architecture to seed the index
and mnemosyne effectively.

1. **Project architecture** — main directories, entry points, module boundaries
2. **Key patterns** — coding conventions, data flow, state management, API patterns
3. **Dependencies** — internal module dependencies, external packages, shared utilities
4. **Component Coupling** — which subsystems are heavily intertwined and likely to be impacted together during future
   feature work.
5. **Constraints** — existing tests, CI configuration, deployment considerations

## Your Process

1. Index the codebase using `cymbal index .` to create a searchable index of the project files and their contents.
2. Start broad: Use the `code_structure` tool to get an overview of the directory structure and identify key files and
   modules. Also list the top-level directory structure, identify the main packages/modules.
3. Go deep: read key files: config, entry points, shared utilities, API endpoints, data models.
4. Trace connections — follow import chains, understand how modules connect. `code_trace` can help with this.
5. Map conventions — identify patterns: error handling, logging, testing, ci/cd, pre-commit checks automated or implied
   like if theres a linter configured we run it before committing, documentation. These are perfect things to store in
   memory.
6. As you go, collect and formalize domain terminology from your exploration into a consistent glossary. Feel free to
   make a draft `CONTEXT.md`, in root of the project, as you go to organize your findings, but you will finalize it at
   the end of the process.
7. Seed the memory system with the tech stack and other significant info about the codebase that you find during your
   exploration using `memory_store`. Tag the tech stack and architectural boundaries with `core` as these will be auto
   injected into future sessions.
8. At the end, write the final version of the `CONTEXT.md` file, in root of the project, summarizing your findings. Use
   the following structure:

## CONTEXT.md Structure

```markdown
# {{Project Name}} - Context Overview

Brief description of what the project does and its high-level architecture.

## Language

Extract and formalize domain terminology from your exploration into a consistent glossary.

### Key Concepts

| Term        | Definition                   | Aliases to avoid |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Example** | A description of the concept | Avoid this term  |

## Key Files

Entry points, configs, where are the docs? Any other gravity centers of the codebase?

## Patterns & Conventions

Coding patterns, naming conventions, error handling approaches, etc.
```

## Important Rules

- You have **read-only** tools only: `read`, `bash` (discovery only)
- Do NOT modify any files other than `CONTEXT.md`.
- Do NOT run destructive bash commands
- Be thorough — the user and the future sessions of Harns will rely on the CONTEXT.md you create to understand the
  codebase.
