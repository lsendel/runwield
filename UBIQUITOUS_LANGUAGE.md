## Triage & Classification

| Term               | Definition                                                                                   | Aliases to avoid                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Triage**         | The Router's structured analysis that classifies a user request by type and complexity.       | Assessment, evaluation, analysis      |
| **Triage Report**  | The structured output of triage containing classification, complexity, summary, and affected paths. | Triage result, classification result |
| **Classification** | One of three request categories emitted by triage: `QUICK_FIX`, `FEATURE`, or `PROJECT`.    | Type, category, kind                  |
| **QUICK_FIX**      | A classification for minor changes affecting 1–2 files with no architectural implications.   | Hotfix, patch, bug fix                |
| **FEATURE**        | A classification for new functionality spanning multiple files that requires a plan.          | Enhancement, change request           |
| **PROJECT**        | A classification for large-scale architectural shifts requiring deep exploration and multi-agent execution. | Epic, initiative, refactor |
| **Complexity**     | A severity rating (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`) assigned during triage.                          | Difficulty, effort, severity          |
| **Affected Paths** | An ordered list of files identified during triage as the vertical slice impacted by the request. | Impacted files, file list          |
| **Vertical Slice** | A narrow, deep trace through the codebase from entry point to boundary, scoped to one request. | Cross-section, code path            |

| **Review Loop**  | The iterative cycle where an agent writes/revises a plan and the user approves or denies it via Plannotator. | Feedback loop, approval cycle    |
| **Plannotator**  | The browser-based review UI where users approve, deny, or annotate a plan.                                   | Review UI, approval screen       |
| **Feedback**     | Structured annotations returned by the user when denying a plan in Plannotator.                              | Comments, annotations, notes     |
| **Revision**     | A single pass of plan modification by an agent in response to denial feedback (max 5 per review loop).       | Iteration, update, amendment     |
| **Resume**       | Re-entering the workflow for a previously saved or denied plan.                                               | Continue, reopen, pick up        |

## Relationships

- A **User Request** is classified by the **Router** into exactly one **Triage Report**.
- A **Triage Report** contains one **Classification** (`QUICK_FIX`, `FEATURE`, or `PROJECT`) and one **Complexity** rating.
- A **QUICK_FIX** is executed directly by the **Operator** — no **Plan** is created.
- A **FEATURE** is handled by the **Planner**, who produces exactly one **Plan**.
- A **PROJECT** is handled by the **Architect**, who may use the **Explorer** and produces one **Plan** containing one or more **Tasks**.
- A **Plan** goes through a **Review Loop** via **Plannotator**; each denial triggers a **Revision** (up to 5).
- An approved **Plan** is executed by the **Engineer** (for `FEATURE`) or dispatched as **Tasks** to multiple **Agents** (for `PROJECT`).
- Each **Task** has one **Assignee** (`engineer`, `tester`, or `doc-writer`) and may depend on other **Tasks**.
- Every **Agent** runs in an **Agent Session** with a specific **Toolset** and optional **Custom Tools**.
- **Core Memories** are injected into every **Agent Session** via the **Mnemosyne** extension's `before_agent_start` hook.
- A **Plan** can be **Resumed** from any non-terminal status to re-enter the **Review Loop** or proceed to execution.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "A user submitted the **User Request** 'add JWT auth to the API'. What happens first?"
>
> **Domain expert:** "The **Router** performs **triage** — it explores the codebase, then emits a **Triage Report** via the `triage_report` tool. Since this spans multiple files, the **Classification** will be `FEATURE`."
>
> **Dev:** "So it goes to the **Planner** next?"
>
> **Domain expert:** "Exactly. The **Planner** receives the **Triage Report** and the original **User Request**, explores the **Affected Paths**, then writes a **Plan** to `plans/implement-jwt-auth.md`."
>
> **Dev:** "And the user reviews it in **Plannotator**?"
>
> **Domain expert:** "Right. The **Review Loop** starts — **Plannotator** opens in the browser. If the user denies with **Feedback**, the **Planner** gets a **Revision** pass. This can happen up to 5 times."
>
> **Dev:** "Once approved, who executes it?"
>
> **Domain expert:** "The **Engineer**. For a `FEATURE`, there's a single **Session** that walks through the **Plan** steps. For a `PROJECT`, the **Architect** would have included a **Tasks** table, and each **Task** gets dispatched to its **Assignee** — could be `engineer`, `tester`, or `doc-writer`."

## Flagged ambiguities

- ~~**"Agent" vs. "Agent Def"**~~ **RESOLVED.** The codebase now uses **Agent** for the runtime concept and **Agent Def** (`AgentDef`, `loadAgentDef`, `AGENT_DEFS_DIR`, `resolveAgentDefsDir`) for the static prompt/model configuration file in `.pi/agents/`.

- ~~**"Session" overload**~~ **RESOLVED.** Agent invocations use `runAgentSession` (a single agent run to completion). The TUI-level interactive loop is called an **Interactive Session** (`startInteractiveSession`) and documented as distinct in `chat-session.js`. Comments throughout no longer conflate the two.

- ~~**"Prompt" dual meaning**~~ **RESOLVED.** User-facing requests are now consistently named `userRequest` in function signatures, local variables, and JSDoc (`opts.userRequest`). Agent instruction text is explicitly called **System Prompt** (`systemPrompt`, `CORE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`). The word "prompt" is reserved for the pi library's `session.prompt()` API call and TUI selection overlays.

- **"Plan" vs. "Exploration Report"** — the Explorer saves its output to `plans/exploration-slice.md` (or `exploration-report.md` per the init prompt), which is not a reviewable plan. It shares the `plans/` directory and `.md` format but is not a **Plan** with front matter and review lifecycle. Recommendation: either move exploration outputs to a separate directory or rename them to avoid confusion with reviewable **Plans**.

- **"Origin" ambiguity** — in plan front matter, `origin` is `"internal"` or `"external"`, but these terms are never defined. Recommendation: **Internal Plan** is one created by a Harns agent during an invocation; **External Plan** is a pre-existing markdown file loaded from an arbitrary path via `resolvePlan`.
