# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Project "Harns"

## 1. Vision & Strategy

**Harns** is an opinionated, developer-first coding harness designed for deep
architectural alignment and token efficiency. It moves beyond "chat-and-hope" AI
by enforcing a "Plan-by-Default" philosophy, utilizing persistent project
memory, and treating the SDLC as a series of intentional gates.

## 2. Core Philosophies

- **Plan-by-Default:** Most tasks start with structural planning rather than
  immediate code execution.
- **Token Parsimony:** Minimize context pollution. Spend tokens upfront
  (indexing/init) to save them during every subsequent turn.
- **Architectural Intent:** Provide specialized agents (Architect, PM, Coder,
  etc.) that respect the project's "Gravity Centers."
- **Session Persistence:** Branching, tree-based session states that can span
  days and survive interruptions.

## 3. Core Features & Functional Requirements

### 3.1 The TUI Shell & Agent Workflows

The primary interface for Harns is the TUI Shell. It acts as a universal host
for interacting with different agents. By default, when the TUI opens, the user
talks to the **Router** agent. The Router is not a special system wrapper; it is
a peer agent (like the Architect, Planner, or Coder) that simply acts as the
default triage point.

**The Router (Adaptive Path Engine):** When active, the Router automatically
triages incoming requests into one of three paths:

- **Quick Fix:** Troubleshooting and rapid changes with no upfront decisions.
  Uses Debugger or Execution agents.
- **Feature:** Requires upfront clarification and a structured plan. Can be
  decomposed into dependent tasks.
- **Project:** Large-scale changes. Requires a dedicated **Explore Agent** for
  context gathering and an **Architect Agent** for a formal proposal.

**Dynamic Agent Switching:** Users can switch the active agent they are
conversing with using slash commands (e.g. `/resume <plan>`). When `/resume` is
invoked, the TUI drops the Router and connects the user directly to the Planner
or Architect agent managing that specific plan. This works seamlessly whether
the TUI was already running or if it was started via `hns resume <plan>`.

### 3.2 Advanced Memory & Indexing

- **Mnemosyne Integration:** (Active) A "Day Zero" memory system that gathers
  core memories, user preferences, and project architecture during `init`.
  Supports global and project-scoped persistent memory with `core` tagging for
  critical context.
- **Memory Maintenance:** Includes a `sleep` command for memory cleanup,
  organization, and optimization using built-in operator prompts.
- **Hybrid Indexing:** Fast structural mapping using `ripgrep` and
  `Tree-sitter`, with semantic search powered by `LanceDB`.
- **Project Brief:** A highly compressed "DNA" summary injected into every
  prompt to maintain context without bloat.

### 3.3 Dynamic Agent Specialization ("The Forge")

- **Base Agents:** Systems Architect, Product Manager, Documentation Writer,
  Coder, Debugger, Test Writer, Security Reviewer, Operator.
- **Customization:** Users can "plug in" skills to create specialized agents
  (e.g., "Playwright Test Writer").
- **Self-Evolution:** The agent must be capable of building its own
  specializations or extensions.

### 3.4 Multi-Model Broker

- **Mapping:** Configuration-based mapping of LLMs to tasks based on Price/Skill
  ratio.
- **Provider Support:** Support for Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenCode Zen,
  Ollama, and LMStudio.
- **Provider-Specific Prompts:** Ability to tweak system prompts per
  provider/agent combo for quality optimization.

### 3.5 Skills & Tools

- **Open Standard:** Support for the skill open standard (used by Claude
  Code/OpenCode).
- **CLI Focus:** Favor CLI-based tools (e.g., `gh`, `glab`) over heavy MCP
  implementations.
- **MCP Plugin:** MCP support remains an optional, non-default plugin to avoid
  context pollution.

### 3.6 Safety & Guardrails

- **Git Awareness:** Mandatory check for a clean working tree. Offer to commit,
  stash, or bypass.
- **Shell Safety:** Integration of OS-level guardrails (e.g., `rbash`
  principles) and regex blacklists for destructive commands.
- **Governance Agent:** Optional "Architecture Guardrail" skill to check diffs
  against `GUIDELINES.md`.

## 4. Technical Stack

- **CLI Environment:** Deno (for security and native permissions).
- **Frontend/Dashboard:** Potential Astro integration for visual plan reviews
  and Plannotator wrapping.
- **Persistence:** SQLite/LanceDB for local indexing and Mnemosyne storage.
- **Versioning:** Support for Git Worktrees to isolate agent execution from the
  primary workspace.

## 5. Success Metrics

- **Token Efficiency:** Reduction in average prompt context compared to
  competitors.
- **Success Rate:** Percentage of tasks successfully executed without manual
  plan revision.
- **Speed to First Plan:** Latency from prompt to the delivery of an actionable
  blueprint.
